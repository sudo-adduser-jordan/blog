## Nix Does Not Fix This

### A Guide For The Impatient

No nix does not fix anything. I am still trying to convince my self creating my flake was worth it.

Previously, and currently, I use git.

Git is meta, git is easy, git is hashed.

git pull

git push 

Why do people think they need more than this? I do not understand.

This is a no boul shit guide for the impatient, for those who don't want to read non developers ( users and developers ) craziness.

## Nix

What is nix? Basically rewriting configuration files to nix to be saved as state. The same thing can be accomplished with a git file.

The idea is to modulize configuration and make it easy to share and use.

I did not have this experience. The learning curve is similar to that of a programming language.

I would never reccommend this to a user. To a developer as a fun project? maybe.

Networking professional? maybe.

## Guide

How to install any envirnoment easily in one file. 

This is all you need as a regular linux user.

You can stop reading here. The following is provided reasouces, mostly for program configurations, that are actually usesful.

They are listed and described.

## Flakes

Input 

Output

## Hardware 

Produced at install time.

Do not touch unless you need something specific.

## Configuration

All you need to use nix.

## Home manager (program settings, dotfiles, etc)

The 'fun' part.

I hope you like converting standard formats to nix by hand because there isnt a formater.

AI works well, after all its going to take our jobs, god forbid it converts the long configuration file one to one.
