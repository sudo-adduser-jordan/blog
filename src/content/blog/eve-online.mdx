## Eve OnLinux A Gamers Guide

Due to the reoccuring questions in the linux Discord channel this guide has been created.

To update this guide please contribute or file an issue here [`https://github.com/sudo-adduser-jordan/sudo-adduser-jordan.github.io`](https://github.com/sudo-adduser-jordan/sudo-adduser-jordan.github.io). 

### Overview

First make sure you hardware meets the specifications listed here link.

Then choose a distribution and a listed option. It doesn't matter, they all will work with the correct configurations.

Some are more difficult to configure than others.

No it does not matter what linux distribution you use.

The only way you will gain any performace from your hardware is by compiling the programs you are executing.

This can be done on any distribution, but using Gentoos Portage Emerge is highly reccommended, as this will flag out many dependencies from the end binary.

All binary served repositories are Generic and flag in Everything into the end result.

Again, to do this you must take the time to correctly configure your system.

Which is what this guide aims to provide you.

### Options
- bottles (highly reccommended, can use the same modified wine as steam)
- steam
- lutris
- wine

### Linux Notes
- compositors may affect performace 
- any distribution works
- xdg portals is required
- debian requires testing branch or backports for updated drivers and / or nvida drivers ( debian has high quality binaries - the industry standard )
